This is the starting page for a workshop introducing R for the School of Psychology at Adelaide University. The workshop is being conducted by:

* Dr William Ngiam (lead)

* A/Prof Rachel Searston

* Dr Toby Prike

This workshop is an introduction to R designed for participants with no
programming experience. The lessons in this workshop were adapted from those developed by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
The Carpentries's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in
less time, and with less pain. 

The workshop covers R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the
structure of data frames, how to wrangle data with dplyr and tidyr, and a brief introduction to plotting and RMarkdown.
